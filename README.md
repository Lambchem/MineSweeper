# MineSweeper
Simple MineSweeper by C#
It's just a simple minesweeper game with three modes, similar to what you have on Windows.
There is no custom mode for the time being, but by modifying the ReadOnly property of the TextBox, you can also implement a custom minesweeper - this is only done because the typography of the custom minesweeper is not good
